# Transforming Programming

All programs transform data, converting an input into an output. When we think about design, we rarely think about creating transformations.
Instead, we worry about classes and modules, data structures and algorithms, languages and frameworks.

Developers need to get back to thinking of programs as being something that transforms inputs into outputs.
When we do that, the structure becomes clearer, the error handling more consistent, and the coupling drops way down.

In C#, transforming programming can be applied using LINQ (Language Integrated Query) and immutable data structures, where data is transformed in a declarative and functional way. Instead of mutating existing data, we generate new transformed data, which aligns with the principles of transforming programming.

## Key Concepts in Transforming Programming (in C#)

1. Immutability:
   - In transforming programming, data is often immutable, which means that once data is created, it cannot be changed. 
   - Instead of changing the data, you create a new instance of the data that reflects the transformation. 
   - C# collections like List<T>, IEnumerable<T>, and IReadOnlyList<T> can be used in an immutable way by not directly modifying the existing collections.
2. Pure Functions:
   - A pure function always produces the same output for the same input and does not have any side effects (e.g., changing external variables, writing to a database). 
   - Transforming programming relies heavily on pure functions to transform data.
3. Declarative Transformation:
   - In transforming programming, we describe what we want the outcome to be, not how to achieve it. 
   - C# allows us to express these transformations declaratively using LINQ or extension methods on collections.
4. Chaining Transformations:
   - Transformations are often applied in a pipeline or chain, where data flows through various functions or operations in sequence. 
   - For example, you can filter, map, and sort data using a sequence of transformations in a declarative manner.

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        // Original list of integers
        var numbers = new List<int> { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };

        // Transformation: 
        // 1. Multiply each number by 2
        // 2. Filter out the numbers greater than 6
        // 3. Sort the numbers in descending order
        var transformedNumbers = numbers
            .Select(x => x * 2)                // Multiply each number by 2
            .Where(x => x > 6)                 // Filter: Keep numbers > 6
            .OrderByDescending(x => x)         // Sort in descending order
            .ToList();

        // Print the transformed numbers
        transformedNumbers.ForEach(Console.WriteLine);
    }
}
