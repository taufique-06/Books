# Knowledge Portfolio

1. Invest Regularly
2. Diversify: The more different things you know, the more valuable
      you are. As a baseline, you need to know the ins and outs of the
      particular technology you are working with currently. But don’t
      stop there. The face of computing changes rapidly—hot technology
      today may well be close to useless (or at least not in demand) tomorrow. The more technologies you are comfortable with, the better
      you will be able to adjust to change.
3. Buy low, sell high. Learning an emerging technology before it becomes popular can be just as hard as finding an undervalued stock,
   but the payoff can be just as rewarding. Learning Java when it first
   came out may have been risky, but it paid off handsomely for the
   early adopters who are now at the top of that field.
4. Review and Re-balance. This is a very dynamic industry. That hot
   technology you started investigating last month might be stone cold
   by now. Maybe you need to brush up on that database technology
   that you haven’t used in a while. Or perhaps you could be better positioned for that new job opening if you tried out that other
   language. . . .

# Goals

1. <b>Learn at least one new language every year:</b> Different languages
solve the same problems in different ways. By learning several different approaches, you can help broaden your thinking and avoid
getting stuck in a rut.
2. <b>Read a technical book each quarter: </b> Bookstores are full of technical books on interesting topics related to your current project. Once
   you’re in the habit, read a book a month. After you’ve mastered the
   technologies you’re currently using, branch out and study some
   that don’t relate to your project.
3. <b>Read nontechnical books: </b> It is important to remember that
   computers are used by people—people whose needs you are trying
   to satisfy. Don’t forget the human side of the equation.
4. <b>Experiment with different environments: </b> If you’ve worked only in
   Windows, play with Unix at home (the freely available Linux is perfect for this). If you’ve used only makefiles and an editor, try an
   IDE, and vice versa.
