# Chapter 1 - A Pragmatic Philosophy

### The cate ate my source code

One of the cornerstones of the the pragmatic philosophy is the idea of taking responsibility for yourself and your actions in terms of the career advancement. Pragmatic Programmers take charge of their career and is not afraid of admitting ignorance or error.It is not the most pleasant aspect of the programming but it will happen --- even on the best of projects. Things can happen and we try to deal with them as professionally as we can. This means being honest and direct. We can proud of our abilities, but we must own up to our shortcomings - our ignorance and our mistakes. 

### Be a Listener
If you want people to listen to you, then listen to them.

## Effective Communicator
Having the best ideas, the finest code or the most pragmatic thinking is ultimately sterile unless you can communicate with other people.
The more effective that communication, the more influential you become. 
### Take Responsibility

When you make a mistake (as we all do) or an error in judgment, admit it honestly and try to offer options.
Don’t blame someone or something else, or make up an excuse. Don’t
blame all the problems on a vendor, a programming language, management, or your coworkers. Any and all of these may play a role, but it is
up to you to provide solutions, not excuses.
If there was a risk that the vendor wouldn’t come through for you, then
you should have had a contingency plan. If the disk crashes—taking
all of your source code with it—and you don’t have a backup, it’s your
fault. <b>Telling your boss “the cat ate my source code” just won’t cut it.</b>
<br />

Before you approach anyone to tell them why something can’t be done,
is late, or is broken, stop and listen to yourself. Talk to the rubber
duck on your monitor, or the cat. Does your excuse sound reasonable,
or stupid? How’s it going to sound to your boss?
Run through the conversation in your mind. What is the other person
likely to say? Will they ask, “Have you tried this ” or “Didn’t you consider that?” How will you respond? Before you go and tell them the bad
news, is there anything else you can try? Sometimes, you just know
what they are going to say, so save them the trouble.
Instead of excuses, provide options. Don’t say it can’t be done; explain
what can be done to salvage the situation. Does code have to be thrown
out? Educate them on the value of refactoring (see Refactoring, page
184). Do you need to spend time prototyping to determine the best way
to proceed (see Prototypes and Post-it Notes, page 53)? Do you need to
introduce better testing (see Code That’s Easy to Test, page 189, and
Ruthless Testing, page 237) or automation (see Ubiquitous Automation,
page 230) to prevent it from happening again? Perhaps you need additional resources. Don’t be afraid to ask, or to admit that you need
help.
Try to flush out the lame excuses before voicing them aloud. If you
must, tell your cat first. After all, if little Tiddles is going to take the
blame. . . .

### Software Entropy
When disorder increases in software, programmers call it
“software rot/technical debt.”

Don’t leave “broken windows” (bad designs, wrong decisions, or poor
code) unrepaired. Fix each one as soon as it is discovered. If there is
insufficient time to fix it properly, then board it up. Perhaps you can
comment out the offending code, or display a "Not Implemented" message, or substitute dummy data instead. Take some action to prevent
further damage and to show that you’re on top of the situation.

if you find yourself on a team and a project where
the code is pristinely beautiful—cleanly written, well designed, and
elegant—you will likely take extra special care not to mess it up, just
like the firefighters. Even if there’s a fire raging (deadline, release date,
trade show demo, etc.), <b>you don’t want to be the first one to make a
mess. </b>

## Remember the bigger picture
Constantly review what is happening around you, not just what you are doing. Simple term, keep an eye out on the bigger picture.

## Knowledge Portfolio

## Critical Thinking

## Choose your moment
It’s six o’clock on Friday afternoon, following a week when the auditors
have been in. Your boss’s youngest is in the hospital, it’s pouring rain
outside, and the commute home is guaranteed to be a nightmare. This
probably isn’t a good time to ask her for a memory upgrade for your PC.
As part of understanding what your audience needs to hear, you need
to work out what their priorities are. Catch a manager who’s just been
given a hard time by her boss because some source code got lost, and you’ll have a more receptive listener to your ideas on source code repositories. Make what you’re saying relevant in time, as well as in content.
Sometimes all it takes is the simple question “Is this a good time to talk
about...?”
