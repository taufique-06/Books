# Critical Thinking

The last important point is to think critically about what you read
and hear. Never underestimate the power of commercialism. Just because a Web
search engine lists a hit first doesn’t mean that it’s the best match; the
content provider can pay to get top billing. Just because a bookstore
features a book prominently doesn’t mean it’s a good book, or even
popular; they may have been paid to place it there.

A few questions to ask and think about

1. Ast the "Five Why's" - Ask why? at least 5 times. Ask a question and get an answer. Dig deeper by asking "why?". Repeat as if you were a petulant 4 year old.
2. Who does it benefit? 
3. What's the context? - Everything occurs in its own context. Consider an article or book about best practice. Good question to consider are "best for who?". What are the prerequisites, what are the consequences, short and long term?
4. When and where would this work? - Under what circumstances? Is it too late or early? Do not stop with first order thinking but use second-order thinking: what will happen after that?
5. Why is this a problem?
