# A Pragmatic Approach

The first two sections, DRY - The Evils of Duplication and Orthogonality, are closely
related. The first warns you not to duplicate knowledge throughout
your systems, the second not to split any one piece of knowledge across
multiple system components.

## The Essence of Good Design

Good design is easier to change the bad design. 

ETC - Easier to change. 

1. <b>Why is decoupling good?</b> Decoupling means minimizing dependencies between system. By isolating concerns we make each easier to change. ETC
2. <b>Why is the single responsibility principle useful?</b> - Because a change in requirements is mirrored by a change in just one module. ETC
3.  <b>Why naming is good?</b> Because good names make code easier to read and you have to read it to change it. 

Also ask:

Did the thing I just did make the overall system easier or harder to change. Do it when you save a file? Do it when you write a test. Do it when you fix a bug.
